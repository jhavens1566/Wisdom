This is a resurection of some very old code with some historical significance.

This is a work in progress, the text parsing is NOT safe or good yet, but
works good enough for just the first two sample files. It is designed to
compile into very small .exe for windows.

build on windows:
  - install mingw
  - make clean all

cross build on linux for win32 target:
  - apt-get install mingw-w64
  - make CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc WISE=wisdom.exe clean all
  - runs fine under wine

build on Linux/UNIX for Linux/UNIX:
  - todo:
